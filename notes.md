In the talk I would focus on 3 main parts:
- game engines in Rust and which one I picked and why
- how I approach game making and the process
- demoing the game and showing some code


Public Description

When you're trying to learn a new programming language it makes sense to start with a small project. A lot of developers would write an API server or a Twitter bot.
When I try to learn a new language I start by writing a game.
Let me show you how I wrote my first game in Rust with Piston.
