Private Description

In the talk I would focus on 3 main parts:
- game engines in Rust and which one I picked and why
- how I approach game making and the process
- demoing the game and showing some code


Public Description

When you're trying to learn a new programming language it makes sense to start with a small project. A lot of developers would write an API server or a Twitter bot.
When I try to learn a new language I start by writing a game.
Let me show you how I wrote my first game in Rust with Piston.

Making games in Rust


--

Hi I'm Lisa

I work at Travis

where I do frontend coding

--

I like making (and playing) video games

--

Why games?

It's art

It's programmatically challenging

It involves logic, graphics, sound and interaction

It's fun

--

Why Rust?

It could be anything!

Big titles are programmed in C or C++

Indie games can be made in anything.

--

fun Fact: I tried learning C++

All game book I read had code examples in C++

- AI for game developers
- Physics for game developers
- Game programming patterns

started learning with the hard way :tm: series

But it was hard and nobody I talked to could or wanted to help me.


"Don't learn C it's horrible"

That's the story of how I didn't learn C.

Enter Rust as new systems level programming language.

There immediately was more appealing because people were excited about it.

There was community.

--

So games in Rust

--

We need an engine

because I'm no game programming genius

What is out there

arewegameyet.com

lists gaming Rust resources

enignes lists a few

Piston!

Why Piston?

It's been around for the longest!

I liked the modular approach

- take what you need for a small game
- once ready and familiar plug in more

2d and 3d capabilities

But

Generated docs are not 100% complete, could use some more human language.

I found one very good tutorial.

Rest of the documentation is in the example games or games on GitHub.

Not super beginner friendly, neither rust or piston or game programmig beginner.

But I was able to fumble my way through it and so can you!

The game!

Manzana Attack!

A lot my games are inspired by personal stories or experience.
Or random thoughts that I explored further.

This happened in March in Madrid!

MELet's play the game

--

Let's look at the parts

main piston setup

Player controls

Throwables

Apples

Folks

Sound

And that's it.
